npm start vs npm dev

npm start 
    - When running the npm start command from the root direvctory of the project, node iwll look for a 'scripts' object in thenpackage.json file. Once found with the key 'start', it will run the command that is specified as it's value.

npm dev
    - Indicated that we are running the peoject in development mode and we are using 'nodemon' to do so.
    - nodemon allows us to make changes without having to restart the server after each change.

node_modules
    - packaged that npm installs that allow our application and all of its dependencies to run properly.
    
 package-lock.json
    - locks in tge versionof the packages that we are using.   
    - version control system that acts as a failsafe.

Express
    - lightweight web application framework used to help organize our application into MVC architecture within our server.
        - MVC: Modle View Controller
    - Not a modle view controller freamework by itself. Still need to use our own ORM (object-relational mapping) library.
        -#Sequelize

Sequelize =>
    - Sequelizeis a JS library that we'll use to manage our PostgreSQL databases
    - Sequelize is an object relational mapper (ORM) -meaning that it sends our data to our databases using JS object syntax
    - Sequelize is all about Models. Models are how we shape the data we'll be sedning to our databases
    - Our models are both the objects that we'll interact with in our application as the primary tab;es that we'll create and manage in our databases

PG 
    - The pg package allows us to write the dialect that sequelize need to speak to our PostgreSQL databases

    DB Connection URI => database://user:password@host/dbname
